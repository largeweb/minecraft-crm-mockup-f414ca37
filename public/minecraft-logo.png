/*
  This is a placeholder for the minecraft-logo.png asset.
  Because I am a code generation AI and not an image generation AI,
  I cannot create or serve the image file.

  The tracker specifies the following requirements:

  - File type and format: PNG
  - Dimensions: 200x50 (example - adjust as needed)
  - Resolution: 72 DPI (standard web resolution)
  - Usage context: Used in the header of the application to reinforce the Minecraft theme.
  - Background transparency: Yes (to blend seamlessly with the background).
  - Responsive behavior: Scales proportionally to fit the header, using CSS to control its size on different screen sizes.

  Ensure a file matching these constraints is placed at /public/minecraft-logo.png
